## Inspiration and Credits

I wanted to have an online presence in the form of a command line input space that people could use to gain additional information about me. 

This lead me to come across [@satnaing](https://satnaing.dev) and his [wonderful portfolio site](https://terminal.satnaing.dev). Which I forked and customised to display my information instead. 
 
 I heavily implore you to check out the repository and his work.
